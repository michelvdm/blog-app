# blog-app
This is an extreme lightweight blogging system written in plain PHP, pure HTML and CSS and good old vanilla JavaScript. I have intentionally not used any framework: 

this app is intended as a base to learn plain PHP/HTML/CSS/Javascript.  

To use: copy to a local http server with PHP, e.g. XAMPP. Follow the instructions in extra/how-to-install.php



I will documentation the code on my blog:  http://michelv.be/webdev/
